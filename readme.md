## Synopsis

A logging framework based on log4php, with a WordPress orientation.

## Motivation

When we looked for a logger plugin we couldn’t find one that quite met 
our needs in the WordPress plugin repository, so we decided to write our own.

## Installation, Code Examples, and Test

For more information on using the logger please visit http://logger.foxdellcodesmiths.com/
